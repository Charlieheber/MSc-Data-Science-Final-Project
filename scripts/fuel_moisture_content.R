# The response of 1-hour timelag fuels to changes in the environmental conditions is so rapid that only the potential
# moisture content, which is equivalent to the EMC at the fuel-atmosphere interface, is required. The first task is to
# estimate the relative humidity and dry bulb temperature of the air in immediate contact with the fuel elements
# (TMPPRM and RHPRM). The approach, based on work by Byram and Jemison (1943), consists of correcting the
# dry bulb temperature and relative humidity values existing at instrument height (4.5 ft) according to the intensity of
# the insolation (amount of sunshine). Time of year or variables affecting insolation other than cloudiness are not considered. The amount of cloudiness is indicated by the stateof-weather code. The temperature correction is added (Â° F);
# the relative humidity correction is a multiplier

# Because of the slow response of the 100-hour and the
# 1000-hour classes of fuels to changes in environmental
# conditions, we use an EMC that represents the average
# drying-wetting potential of the atmosphere for the preceding 24-hour period. The 24-hour average EMC is
# denoted as EMCBAR, a weighted average of EMCMAX
# and EMCMIN. Weighting is done on the basis of hours of
# daylight and hours of darkness that are functions of latitude and date

# Duration of Daylight:

# PHI = LAT * 0.01745

# in which
# LAT is the station latitude in degrees.
# DECL = 0.41008 * SIN((JDATE-82) * 0.01745) 

# in which
# JDATE is the Julian date.
# DECL is the solar declination in radians.
# DAYLIT = 24 * (1. - ACOS(TAN(PHI)
#                          * TAN(DECL))/3.1416)


# in which DAYLIT is the number of hours between sunrise
# and sunset. 

# Weighted 24-Hour Average EMC:
# EMCBAR = (DAYLIT * EMCMIN + (24.0 - DAYLIT) * EMCMAX) / 24.0
# Weighted 24-Hour Average Boundary Condition:
# BNDRYH = ((24.0 - PPTDUR) * EMCBAR + PPTDUR * (0.5 * PPTDUR + 41.0)) / 24.0 

# in which PPTDUR is the hours of precipitation reported
# (predicted) for the 24-hours.

# 100-Hour Timelag Fuel Moisture: The model used in the
# manual version of the 1978 NFDRS to calculate the 100-
# hour timelag fuel moisture differs from this model in two
# ways: 
# (1) daylength is not considered, and 
# (2) the 24-hour average EMC is a function of the simple averages of the
# 24-hour temperature and relative humidity extremes.

# MC100 = YMC100 + (BNDRYH - YMC100) * (1.0 - 0.87 * EXP(-0.24))

# in which YMC100 is the MC100 value calculated the previous day.

# Initializing YMC100 at the Beginning of a Computational Period:
#   YMC100 = 5.0 + (5.0 * CLIMAT)
