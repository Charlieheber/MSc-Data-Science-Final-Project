# The response of 1-hour timelag fuels to changes in the environmental conditions is so rapid that only the potential
# moisture content, which is equivalent to the EMC at the fuel-atmosphere interface, is required. The first task is to
# estimate the relative humidity and dry bulb temperature of the air in immediate contact with the fuel elements
# (TMPPRM and RHPRM). The approach, based on work by Byram and Jemison (1943), consists of correcting the
# dry bulb temperature and relative humidity values existing at instrument height (4.5 ft) according to the intensity of
# the insolation (amount of sunshine). Time of year or variables affecting insolation other than cloudiness are not considered. The amount of cloudiness is indicated by the stateof-weather code. The temperature correction is added (Â° F);
# the relative humidity correction is a multiplier

# Next needed is the moisture content that herbaceous
# fuels would have if the greenup period were over; this we
# call MCHRBP (P for Potential). MCHRBP is linearly
# related to X 1000, but the constants of the relationship are
# functions of the NFDRS climate class. 

# MC_herbp = GA_herb + GB_herb * X1000

# NFDRS Climate class: HERBGA HERBGB
# 1                    -70.0 12.8
# 2                    -100.0 14.0
# 3                    -137.5 15.5
# 4                    -185.0 17.4

# The length of the greenup period, in days, is seven times
# the NFDRS climate class. The fraction of greenup period
# that has elapsed must be calculated so that the loading of
# the herbaceous fuel can be calculated.

# GREN = GRNDAY / (7.0 * CLIMAT) 

# in which GRNDAY is the number of days since the greenup
# sequence was started.
